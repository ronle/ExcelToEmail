# ExcelToEmail

The macro in this file will create an email out of pre-defined table named "Chart2"
and pre-defined graph named "Chart1".

The size of these table can change but name definition has to remain the same for the pre-defined areas.
User can delete the provided tables and create a new one, select the entire table area and name is (top left corner of excel file) as "Chart2".
Same can be done for the graphed chart area.
